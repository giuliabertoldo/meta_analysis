summary(FEM1)

## The overall effect is 0.122 (sig. at 5%) meaning
## that males have larger conformity than females

## Is there evidence for heterogeneity?
## Yes, Q statistics, we reject H0


# (2b) Make a forest plot to explore a possible moderating effect of
# the percentage of authors that are male

forest(FEM1)



# (2c) Is there evidence (alpha=1%) for a moderating effect of
# the percentage of authors that are male?
FEMR <- rma(yi=g, vi=SE^2, data=df1, mods=Male, method='FE')
summary(FEMR)
# Intercept is the expected difference in conformity for 0% male authors
# For a unit increase in %male author there is a 0.0076 increase in conformity

## (2d) Is it OK to use FEM?
## No, also based on previous Q statistics
