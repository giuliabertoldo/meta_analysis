# Dataset description

Re-execute the meta-analysis of diagnostic odds ratios from the AuditC-example that comes with the mada-package. Calculate the log odds ratio’s using the metafor- package. Re-meta-analyze the log odds ratio’s using the restricted maximum likelihood procedure in metafor (method = “REML”). Also use the DerSimonian & Laird approach implemented in the metafor-package (method = “DL”). Compare the mean log odds ratio with corresponding 95% confidence interval, as well as the estimated between-study variance.
